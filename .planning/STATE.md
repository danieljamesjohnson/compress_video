# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-15)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Research's "contract/skeleton" and "probe/info/thumbnails" phases merged into Phase 1 (standard granularity; a contract phase alone had only 2 requirements)
- [Roadmap]: Android (Phase 2) before Apple (Phase 3). Phase 3 starts with a Mac-readiness check, and Phases 2 and 3 can run in parallel once the Mac is reachable.
- [Roadmap]: Behaviour requirements are mapped to Phase 2, where they are first delivered. Phase 3 owns the cross-platform parity requirements (CORE-01, CORE-07) and must pass the same corpus tests.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: SSH to `dans-macbook-air` is refused, which blocks Apple device/simulator verification (QUESTIONS.md #1). Phase 1 uses the GitHub Actions macOS runner meanwhile.
- [Phase 1]: The Android SDK and emulator are not yet installed on danserver.
- [Phase 4]: HEVC/HDR hardware checks need a physical Android phone (QUESTIONS.md #3).
- [Phase 6]: No verified pub.dev publisher yet (QUESTIONS.md #2).
